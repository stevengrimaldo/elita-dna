          <p>A fluency disorder, which is often referred to as “stuttering”, is characterized by primary (core) and secondary behaviors. Primary behaviors may include repetitions of sounds, syllables, or whole words; prolongations of single sounds; or blocks of airflow or voicing during speech. Secondary behaviors develop over time as learned reactions to the core behaviors and are categorized as avoidance behaviors. They may include hesitations, interjections of sounds, syllables, or words; word revisions or complete changes in words; or motor movements associated with stuttering (such as eye blinking, loss of eye contact, extraneous movements, to name a few).</p>

A swallowing disorder is also called dysphagia (dis-FAY-juh). Swallowing happens in three stages, or phases. You can have a problem in one or more of these phases.</p>
